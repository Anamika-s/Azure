Create a VM , use Windows 2012

Use RDP 

COnnect

Enable IIS


Check localost in browser

Check in VM IP

Public IP is dynaimc. not static
Means if we stop and restart, it wil chnage
Snapshot : of disk is a vhd , we can attach it to a VM

image that v create is a service in Azure
though its a vhd but it is abstarcted
If u delete any resource in azure, u cannot have it back

some services allow u to restore
like soft delete


snapshots are downloadbale
images when we capture from a VM, we can crete multiple VM's out of tt image, but that VM cn not b used.

Image is created by using Capture option
VM goes to stopped state
Createion of an Image is a 3 step process
1. It stops your VM.
2. After stopping VM, it generalises the VM. Which means It runs a tool inside the VM.
3. Create an Image for you.

VM can be vrreated from an Image in the same region

Capture : Captures the VM by copying virtual hard disks of the VM and outputs a templat ethat can be used tio create similar VM's

Images are stored separetely , but they use stirage accint but that is abstracted from you

VM will move to stopped stste , not bu used now

U can delete it
But u can see in RG , image will be there
U can see Image as a service in Compute

Now u can clik on this image and create VM


REGION CANT BE CHANGED 

SNAPSHOT is used to take backup of ur OS or data disks. They can not be used to ctrate VM.


SSH is encrypted connection protocol which is used for protection



Add Data Disk

Add a folder there
